# Purpose

This document defines the panels architecture for Sewlio Studio.

It describes how the UI surface supports a professional embroidery, CAD, and digitizing workflow without owning domain logic.

All behavior described here is presentation, interaction, or workflow orchestration layered on top of the command system and state projections exposed by the runtime.

---

# Philosophy

The panels is command-driven and state-derived.

UI components may gather intent, display projections, and stage previews, but they must never mutate the project directly or embed embroidery rules that belong in the core engine.

The interface should feel precise, low-latency, and trustworthy for expert operators working on dense, production-bound documents.

---

# Goals

- Provide non-modal inspection
- Provide synchronized selection context
- Provide lazy loading
- Provide consistent commands

---

# Definition

Panels is the UI subsystem responsible for exposing non-modal inspection and synchronized selection context to end users.

Its state is derived from document snapshots, view models, user preferences, task status, and permission-aware extension contributions.

Its outputs are visual feedback, validated intent capture, and command requests dispatched through the application bridge.

---

# Responsibilities

- Render panels state using deterministic projections from the document model and runtime services.
- Collect user intent and translate it into command payloads, tool interactions, or task requests.
- Surface validation, progress, diagnostics, and approval requirements before work reaches the domain engine.
- Support plugin-contributed actions or overlays only through declared extension points and sandboxed UI contracts.

The panels participates in this loop without bypassing command validation, event propagation, or scheduler-owned background work.

# UI Rules

- UI must not own embroidery business rules, machine constraints, or file-format semantics.
- All persistent mutations must be issued as commands and reflected back through runtime state.
- Long-running operations must expose scheduler progress, cancellation, and observable failure states.
- Preview state may be ephemeral, but committed state must always be reproducible from commands and document snapshots.

---

# Out of Scope

- Core document mutation logic.
- Embroidery compilation, simulation physics, and machine encoding internals.
- Persistence formats and storage policy enforcement.
- Background execution primitives owned by the task scheduler.

---

# Future Topics

- Plugin-specific extensions for panels.
- Cross-device adaptations for tablet and web workflows where applicable.
- Advanced telemetry and usage analytics for expert workflow optimization.
- Incremental refinements informed by testing, accessibility audits, and production feedback.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- The panels surface can be implemented without introducing direct domain mutations from UI code.
- All described states and interactions can be derived from documented runtime services, commands, events, and document projections.
- Cross-references align with existing architecture and domain specifications.
- The document is specific enough to guide implementation, testing, and plugin-safe extension design.

# Implementation Status (MVP)

Panels are registered declaratively in
`apps/studio/lib/src/panels/panel_def.dart` (`panelRegistry`) and hosted
by the dock — see UI-202 "Implementation Status" for the framework and
persistence details. Built-in panels: Stitches (UI-509), Layers
(UI-502), Properties (UI-500/501). Panel content widgets are
stateless-props and headless-testable; only their registry builders
touch the workspace view model.
